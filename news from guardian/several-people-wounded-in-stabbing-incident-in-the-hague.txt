 Three people were injured in a stabbing incident in The Hague’s main shopping street on Friday night, Dutch police said. A manhunt was under way. The incident happened in the Grote Marktstraat shopping area, which was busy with people looking for Black Friday deals. An area near the town’s historic centre was cordoned off, and dozens of police and ambulances were on the scene. In a statement, Hague police said they were seeking a man aged 45-50 wearing a shawl, a black jacket and wearing a grey tracksuit. Pictures from the area showed several dozen onlookers kept behind police fencing seeking a glimpse of the area where the stabbing took place. Police spokeswoman Marije Kuiper said that it was not clear if the stabbing was a terror incident.
